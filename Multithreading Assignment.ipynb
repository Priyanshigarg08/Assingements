    "Q1) What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "Ans- It is a concept in which all the resources are accepted in the same code to run the program. Python multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory. Multithreading in Python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks. It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time, thereby increasing the performance.\n",

    "Ans- Threading module allows multiple threads to exceute in the same program. While multiple threads can run simulatenously but only one thraed is executed at a particular time. Threading is helpful when working with tasks that are I/O bound.\n",
    "a) activeCount()- It is a function from the threading module which returns the number of thraeds objects alive.\n",
    "b) currentThread()- This function returns the current thread object corresponding to the caller's thread control.\n",
    "c) enumerate()- This function returns the list of all the current threads alive. This can be useful for iterating over all threads and performing operations."

    "    c) join()- This method waits to execute until child program(i.e subclass) terminates as the child program requires resources In terms of CPU or                    memory. It is basically a closing method so that the resouces will be closed immediately.\n",

    "Q6) Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "Ans Deadlock- A deadlock is a situation in a concurrent computing environment where two or more threads (or processes) are unable to proceed with their execution because each is waiting for the other to release a resource they need. This creates a cycle of dependencies that prevents any of the involved threads from progressing.Deadlock exists when two threads seek one lock simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions-A race condition occurs when the behavior of a software system depends on the relative timing of events, such as the order in which threads execute. This can lead to unpredictable results and bugs because the final outcome depends on the interleaving of operations by different threads.A race condition occurs when two threads use the same variable at a given time.\n",
